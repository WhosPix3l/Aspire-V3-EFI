# Opencore-EFIs
## A database of all my EFIs that I have made!

:exclamation: All EFIs are tested on macOS Big Sur, but should work with relatively modern versions of macOS (High Sierra and up)
:exclamation: When using an EFI, make sure to generate a new serial number and a motherboard serial with **[macserial](https://github.com/acidanthera/macserial)** or **[GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)**

Hello, welcome to my EFI database! I've done quite a few Hackintoshes in the past (most of the EFIs are gone though lmao), and I figured why not place it on GitHub, to maybe help other people. üôÇ

Different EFIs are seperated by branches, please select accordingly for your machine.
I have made EFIs for the
* [Acer Aspire V3-371-31P5](https://www.acer.com/datasheets/2014/4876/V3-371/NX.MPGSN.005.html)
* [Lenovo Yoga 2](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/yoga-laptop-series/yoga-laptop-2-13/) (belongs to **[@losowyLP](https://github.com/losowyLP)**)

Thank you, and have fun with Hackintoshing!

## How do I use it?
* First, select a branch for your machine.
* Next, download the EFI by clicking on the green **Code** button and clicking on **Download ZIP**.
* Then, generate a new serial number and a motherboard serial with **[macserial](https://github.com/acidanthera/macserial)** or **[GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)**. Generate the SMBIOS accordingly.
