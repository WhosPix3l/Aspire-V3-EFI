# Opencore EFI folder, for the Acer Aspire V3-371!

Tested on macOS Mojave, but should work with older and newer versions of macOS.

:exclamation: Don't forget to generate a new SMBIOS with GenSMBios! (I'm using MacBookAir6,2)

:exclamation: This EFI does NOT inject SMBIOS to other operating systems in order to keep drivers working.

:exclamation: This EFI is a work in progress. Even though it boots, not everything has been tested.
